<h1>Life without a home 2023/2024</h1>

<p>Most of you know that I have parted ways with my comfy home in Alexandria and decided to live out of a car for a year, essentially making me homeless.  I never spent a lot of time outside the (north) east coast, and I wanted to go snowboarding in Denver without dealing with Hertz again (a pretty toxic company when dealing with a AWD shortage in a blizzard)!</p>

<p>I spent most of September (2023) decluttering my home and packing things into storage.  Once October came around, though, I flew to Incheon, S. Korea first (my first vaca with the family in a long time).</p>

<p>The last time I went to Korea was in 2009 when the financial world was collapsing, but it didn't really impact me much any ways because I had no money!  I studied aboard there for six months, making the most of my time there as a 21 year old.  The goal of this trip is to experience Korea within the lens of my parents, eat everything good over there, and revisit some places I used to visit back when I was in college.</p>

<p>Note: Unfortunately, my phone died in the middle of the trip, so all my phone photos disappeared (lesson learned, never trust internal storage) and I was left to actually experience Korea for the remainder of the trip until I flew back and got a Pixel 8 at full price.  I don't have enough feature photos to highlight some of the stuff, like conquering the peak of Ulsan-Bawi and Yonsei University.</p>

<p>I did, however, go to some sites I haven't been to before near Sokcho and in Jeju Island.</p>

Shell fish from the Haenyeo divers.  Jeju is a volcanic island, so it's difficult to grow food there.  While all the men escaped the former prison island, the women adapted and dove for their food in the ocean.  You can still watch most of the women dive to this day, and even eat the stuff they caught.

<p>As well as made an effort to eat something different every meal.</p>

<p>I arrived back to DC, packed my car, and drove up to Philly for a week, Boston for another week, and then to New Hampshire, where I was going to test whether I could telework from a home with Spectrum internet near a ski resort away from a city (short answer; I was able to!  I could even play video games with it).</p>

<p>I took this opportunity over three weeks to revisit some of the hiking trails I loved going to as a kid</p>
