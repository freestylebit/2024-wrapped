<h1>Life without a home 2023/2024</h1>

<p>Most of you know that I have parted ways with my comfy home in Alexandria and decided to live out of a car for a year, essentially making me homeless.  I never spent a lot of time outside the (north) east coast, and I wanted to go snowboarding in Denver without dealing with Hertz again (a pretty toxic company when dealing with a AWD shortage in a blizzard)!</p>

<p>I spent most of September (2023) decluttering my home and packing things into storage.  Once October came around, though, I flew to Incheon, S. Korea first (my first vaca with the family in a long time).</p>

<p>The last time I went to Korea was in 2009 when the financial world was collapsing, but it didn't really impact me much any ways because I had no money!  I studied aboard there for six months, making the most of my time there as a 21 year old.  The goal of this trip is to experience Korea within the lens of my parents, eat everything good over there, and revisit some places I used to visit back when I was in college.</p>

<p>Note: Unfortunately, my phone died in the middle of the trip, so all my phone photos disappeared (lesson learned, never trust internal storage) and I was left to actually experience Korea for the remainder of the trip until I flew back and got a Pixel 8 at full price.  I don't have enough feature photos to highlight some of the stuff, like conquering the peak of Ulsan-Bawi and Yonsei University.</p>

<p>I did, however, go to some sites I haven't been to before near Sokcho and in Jeju Island.</p>

Shell fish from the Haenyeo divers.  Jeju is a volcanic island, so it's difficult to grow food there.  While all the men escaped the former prison island, the women adapted and dove for their food in the ocean.  You can still watch most of the women dive to this day, and even eat the stuff they caught.

<p>I arrived back to DC, packed my car, and drove up to Philly for a week, Boston for another week, and then to New Hampshire, where I was going to test whether I could telework from a home with Spectrum internet near a ski resort away from a city (short answer; I was able to!  I could even play video games with it).</p>

<p>I took this opportunity over three weeks to revisit some of the hiking trails I loved going to as a kid</p>

<p>After spending Thanksgiving with the family, I went back up north to Vermont to go skiing at Okemo.  I honestly had a surprisingly great first day, but my second weekend the weather got warmer, and the bunny slopes got trickier thanks to the melted snow.</p>

<p>I will say that New Hampshire/Vermont are amazing places to be introverts, but it can be pretty secluded at times.  Maybe 30 years from now...</p>

<p>Spent the holidays with the family in Rhode Island again, and after New Years, I embarked on my journey across the country (on Rt 70/80) to get to the promise land (a.k.a. Denver).  This journey took two weekends with a two week stay at my friend's place in Des Moine (I had an event to attend in Las Vegas one of the weekends).</p>

<p>On January 21, I successfully made it to Denver, settled into my first Airbnb there...and played in the Dodgeball league(s) I signed up for the same day despite altitude sickness!</p>

<p>The next few months was spent trying to figure out how to maximize my time skiing on the weekends, sampling all the rock climbing gyms in the area (Movement and the Spot are both great chains), and meeting new friends in the area.  My car survived, but barely.  I don't think it made it could make it to Breckenridge, so I settled with Keystone and took the bus to Breckenridge for the remainder of the winter.  I was able to go tap into my Epic Pass at least a dozen time this season.</p>

<p>A short trip to Toronto in April yielded an opportunity to try to majestic seafood:</p>

<p>As well as a weekend camping at Shelf two hours south of Denver to try out some outdoor climbing</p>
